40,138,"This novel starts off with Navajo Tribal Police sergeant Jim Chee finding a corpse in tribal lands near a natural gas field.  The FBI is trying to take over the case, saying that it was a hunting accident.  Joining Chee on the case is the familiar characters of Joe Leaphorn and Bernadette Manuelito.  Conspiracies abound, and not surprisingly, the US government aren't necessarily the good guys.

 This is a solid novel, perhaps a little better than some other Hillerman novels I have read.  The plot is logical, the writing professional.  The downfall is that nothing really stands out about this novel.  Its not the sort of novel that youll remember long after you read it.  Its descent enough to pass the time and is a solid read, but not particularly memorable.

\ Okay \ , but not his \ best \ .
Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS.","Tony Hillerman's THE SINISTER PIG reads like a half-hearted effort to fulfill a contract, \ not \ to tell a good story.
Some great threads are inherent, \ but \ the unravel instead of weave. The reader is bounced from the border where Bernie Manuelito is now working to the Four Corners for a murder. The strongest theme is embezzlement of tribal funds, but here Hillerman waxes \ lightly \ .
Okay, \ but not \ his best.
